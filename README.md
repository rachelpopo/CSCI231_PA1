##CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 1
_working with objects_

* * *

This program allows the user to calculate the area of a 3D triangle by inputting the x, y and z-coordinates of all three points. 
* * *

Point.cpp - defines contstructors and functions used. 

Point.h - states function prototypes and defines the Point class. 

pa1.cpp - defines computeArea function. Asks for user input of x, y, and z-coordinates of all 3 points (9 inputs).
          computes 3D triangle area and outputs end results to user.
